# Bitcointalk.org Autosearcher

This is a simple utility I made to make searching for new altcoin launches easier. The Bitcointalk.org forum has a search panel that requires multiple options to be selected to target specific sections of their discussion board, so I used Selenium to automate this process. You simply enter the keyword you want to search for, how many days back you want to see, and Selenium takes care of the rest. This was a simple prototype that I intended to eventually merge into a more wide-ranging and comprehensive cryptocurrency trader set of tools. The relevant code is in Form1.cs.
